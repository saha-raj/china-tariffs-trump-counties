# Project Goals
- Create an interactive visualization showing the relationship between Trump voting counties and tariff impacts
- Analyze county-level data to reveal economic patterns in political support
- Present complex economic and political data in an accessible, engaging format
- Provide insights into how trade policies affect different voting demographics
- Build a responsive web interface that works across different devices

# Fundamental Principles
- Write clean, simple, readable code
- Implement features in the simplest possible way
- Keep files small and focused (<200 lines)
- Test after every meaningful change
- Focus on core functionality before optimization
- Use clear, consistent naming
- Think thoroughly before coding. Write 2-3 reasoning paragraphs.
- ALWAYS write simple, clean, and modular code.
- Use clear and easy-to-understand language. Write in short sentences.

# Error Fixing
- DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS! Consider multiple possible causes before deciding.
- Explain the problem in plain English.
- Make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines of code as possible.
- In case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a web search or consult with other AIs

# Building Process
- Verify each new feature works by telling the user how to test it.
- DO NOT write complicated and confusing code. Opt for the simple & modular approach.
- When not sure what to do, tell the user to perform a web search.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability over cleverness.
- Ensure every function and module has a clear purpose and is easy to extend or modify.
- Test code incrementally to catch errors early rather than debugging large chunks at once.

# Comments
- ALWAYS try to add more helpful and explanatory comments into our code.
- NEVER delete old comments â€“ unless they are obviously wrong / obsolete.
- Include LOTS of explanatory comments in your code. ALWAYS write 
  descriptive comments that explain why something is done, not just how.
- Keep comments updated when making changes to prevent confusion.
- Use consistent comment styles throughout the project to improve readability.
